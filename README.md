# canxham

A practice exam generator for aspiring Canadian amateur radio operators, forked from VO1ZXZ's original work.

## ChangeLog

The following changes were made after forking VO1ZXZ's original work:
- ANSI color is added
- Only wrong answers are logged. It helps me to review the question and memorize the right answer.
- Download from ISED only when we don't have a local copy of the tests.
  You are still recommended to delete `amat_basic_quest_delim.txt` from time to time, in order to fetch the latest questions.
- Other tiny tweaks.

Please either download VO1ZXZ's original [release](https://github.com/helpkilbananas/canxham/releases), or install Python 3
